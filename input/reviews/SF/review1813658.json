Room was not comfortable but the highlight was there was a great waiter at the restaurant who took great care of us and the food was good. So we try them again couple months later, this time restaurant staff and food are both bad and it cost more. I will never stay here again. A new girl was being trained at front desk, vet could not find my reservation so I gave her all the details she replies: \"Oh it is expedia, you are expedia people, let me tell you about her.\" She proceeds to rudely talk about me as if I am expedia and lets everyone else in line who is not \"expedia people\" go first because she needs time to finish talking. When she is done I notice bags are gone they tell me someone will take them to my room. I did not have pesos yet so bellboy got angry. Going to dinner I could hear him at front desk talking about me. At restaurant there was a nice waiter who exchanged money for us and food was good. He was the only nice person, others kept passing us, glaring, and talking about the bellboy's no tip because he did not want USD story. We tip bellboy in pesos on way back to room and he and front desk laugh at us to our faces. In room bed is not firm and bathroom so small you wet it entirely including towels when showering drain is not even in shower so this is known problem. We check out decide due to restaurant we will try again, it was not all bad. Well bellboy replaced the waiter, service and food was bad","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"On first stay I liked the restaurant my second stay proved they were not improving but devolving and I will not go back","negativeRemarks":"Friendliness and courtesy of front desk staff who are quite rude.
