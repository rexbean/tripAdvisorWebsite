I arrived in a taxi without money to pay for it expecting the hotel to direct me to an ATM nearby. As there was none open in the area at that time of night, the staff at the front desk lent me money to cover the cab until I could get to an ATM later that evening. The staff was also extremely helpful in providing info, arranging for taxis and even helped me order delivery food as the hotel restaurant was closed at the time i wanted to eat.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"Staff were always happy to provide info, call a cab or even assist with ordering delivery food.","negativeRemarks":"Restaurant hours are pretty limited.
