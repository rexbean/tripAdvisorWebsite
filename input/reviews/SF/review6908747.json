The AC didn't work properly. It barely cooled the room in the middle of the day.\nThe taps in the bathroom were leaking but most upsetting so was the toilet every time we flushed.\nThe staff appeared demoralized which was contrary to most of the staff at other places at the beach front where we had meals.\nAnd it wasn't cheap. We certainly felt we did not get our money's worth.\nI wouldn't recommend this accommodation to friends or family.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":2,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"The location is excellent.

It's gloomy and badly finished. Overall, you get what you pay for, but there're better hotels/huts available in the vicinity if you look better.
