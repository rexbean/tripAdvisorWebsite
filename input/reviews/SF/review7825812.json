The building and its features are fairly dated and could use updating/freshening-up/maintenance.  There is a restaurant immediately in front of the hotel which does make it convenient for meals.\r\n\r\nThe hotel was competitively priced at time of booking  but having stayed there, I think I would have paid more to be in a better area and in a slightly more up-to-date hotel.  \r\n\r\nNot all  staff spoke English, but they were all very pleasant and helpful on all accounts.  One gentleman did speak English and he, like his colleagues, was extremely helpful and pleasant to deal with.  The staff is this hotel's top feature and they receive top marks from me.
