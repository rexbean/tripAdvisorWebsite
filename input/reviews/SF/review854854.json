To dine in the former monks refectory with the walls  hung with tapesteries and paintings beneath a wooden beamed ceiling, prepared diners for what was a splendid supper offering a range of Spanish specialities and local dishes. \r\n\r\nThe courtyards and large vegetable garden encourage the visitor to explore the estate.

You could park for free on all the side roads surrounding the hotel so it is perfect if you are on a driving tour round Andalusia. The decoration is quirky and the place grounds are beautiful. The hotel is a good place to stop off between Cordoba and Seville. We visited in late September and found the actual town it is in, Palma del Rio (approx. 40 min drive to Cordoba) is a quite little town, mainly with local people who don't speak English. There were plenty of good cafes and bars near by and we managed to muddle our way through with virtually no Spanish language skills. The restaurant and bar in the hotel were very quite, and far more expensive than the local places, so we avoided them.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"Quirky decoration and grounds, different to anywhere we have stayed before","negativeRemarks":"Information on arrival, i.e. WIFI password, details of breakfast/restaurant","locationRemarks":"There are some sights nearby and Cordoba is ~40 min drive and Seville ~1 hour drive","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"London","reviewSubmissionTime":"2013-10-01T16:35:58Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}],"userDisplayName":"Kate","roomTypeId":35827,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"854854","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"39839505","itinId":"13782136310","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Great Monastery Retreat but Still silent order.","reviewText":"The hotel was fine.

It has 'good bones' and will make a wonderful lodging when the renovations currently ongoing are finished. They are upgrading the facility to qualify for the Spanish four-star hotel category. This unfortunately marred our stay: the bar was not functioning and an evening meal was by special request only, so it really was operating as a bed and breakfast (not included in the room charge). Breakfast was an ample buffet, however, served in what had been the monastery refectory--a grand space. It is useful also to know Palma del Rio lies an hour's drive from Cordoba, which was the focus of our visit.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Belmont, Massachusetts","reviewSubmissionTime":"2011-03-25T12:30:16Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":"","isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"854854","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"20517321","itinId":"19604543","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":5,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Lindsay","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Not a regular hotel","reviewText":"This is not your regular hotel. You could love it or hate it. The walled gardens are lovely and peaceful and we liked these very much. The long narrow swimming pool is set in grass and orange trees one side and attractive vegetable plots the other. Sounds weird but it works, and you gaze at the old monastery building from the pool recliners. It is hard to say the rooms are attractive although they all have unique and attractive features. The inner facing rooms are downright dismal. We were allocated one. The bed was slightly damp, the mattress sagged in the middle, and the lighting gloomy. There was one small north facing window which passersby peer in through, slight air of mouldiness, all in all rather miserable. Everything changed when the room opposite become free. We asked for a change which was freely given. Our new room had two big windows opening to the outside, to the sun and the scent of orange blossom (we stayed in April). Although the room was still very basic and monastic, it had romance and light and we loved this room. So, great hotel with great character and interest but make sure you get an outside facing room. The building is hundreds of years old and the rooms reflect this. Do not expect modern glitzy surroundings although the bathroom fittings and facilities are all clean and newly fitted. We stayed in April, in the overpowering heat of summer everything may appear quite different.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":4,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":3,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Castle Donington","reviewSubmissionTime":"2009-06-12T17:40:47Z","reviewerCategories":[],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":"","isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"854854","totalPositiveFeedbacks":0,"tpid":"3","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_gb","totalThanks":0,"photos":[],"reviewId":"20517312","itinId":"18349623","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"2057","userNickname":"Wendy","brandType":"Expedia","title":"Peace and quiet","reviewText":"We chose this hotel and in fact the area because we wanted to \"be\" rather than \"do\".

The cloisters were lovely with antique furniture and pots of geraniums.
