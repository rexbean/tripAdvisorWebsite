It was right on the sea front and it was a good to have a seaview room. Our room was fine and the bed was very good. Reception recommended a family-run beach company across the road which provided umbrella, sunbed and chairs at a reasonable price and a family-style restaurant, offering delicious food.We ate there every day and enjoyed every meal.\nWe had a great breakfast every day at the hotel, very well supervised by the same highly efficient and charming man. Reception staff were equally at the top of their game and nothing was too much trouble for them.We had hired a car for our trip and reception offered an excellent parking deal which enabled us to park at a reasonable price on the sea front right outside the hotel. We went by car to 3 Puccini operas and, once we had found the way, it took us no more that 20 minutes max. to get to and from Torre del Lago. We felt very comfortable at the hotel and the excellent staff explained everying so there were no surprises at any time. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and would be very happy to return. We strongly recommend Hotel San Francisco, Viareggio.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"The staff and the location.","negativeRemarks":"None","locationRemarks":"Great beach front location ( we did not find noise to be a problem)","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Midlands","reviewSubmissionTime":"2012-08-23T11:39:31Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Couples","categoryLabel":"Couples"}],"userDisplayName":"John","roomTypeId":"","isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"}]}}}
