Too bad more people don't stay there so they can use the other sections of (what turned out to be) an enormous place.  It should be noted that the neighborhood is not the best -- it was very dark at night and I wound up stepping into a 2-foot hole in the pavement just around the corner from the hotel.  Took quite a fall and wound up with some nasty bruises on my knee and leg.
