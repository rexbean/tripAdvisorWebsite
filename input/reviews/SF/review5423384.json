The one hiccup was a three hour wait to check in as the apartment was left very dirty by the previous tenant and it took a team of two several hours to bring it to acceptable cleanliness.\r\n\r\nThe view from the 29th floor is spectacular. The apartment has views 270deg., windows on three sides. The city lights, the ships waiting to enter the Panama Canal, the huge tides of the Pacific, the birds !, the Pelicans splash fishing during high tide, the fishing boats....could go on and on.\r\n\r\nDo the Hop on Hop off bus tour...canal route. Never pay more than 5$. per taxi trip, negotiate with written address first, better to have landmark destination than address, taxi driver's do not know addresses, they know places.\r\n\r\nIf it's beaches you want, San Francisco Apartments may not be for you. Nearest beach is over an hour away...$50. taxi one way. Pool at the apartment is simple but effective, and for a 50 storey building, hardly used at all. Clean and inviting.\r\n\r\nThe apartment could have a little more furniture. Minimalist furnishings, but all the basics.\r\n\r\nHuge apartment footprint. Ours had 2 beds, 2baths, with a maids quarters and separate bath for maid.\r\n\r\nGet the property manager to pick you up at the airport. No confusion about where to check in. English speaking, he'll bring you to the doorstep and check the remotes, hot water and the internet before he leaves.","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":3,"ratingHotelCondition":4,"ratingService":5,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"There is a Super99 supermarket 1 block away.\r\n\r\nAll other attractions must use taxi.\r\n\r\nPanama City is not pedestrian friendly.\r\n","lastInitial":"","userLocation":"Ontario","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-04-10T23:33:58Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"BusinessTravelers","categoryLabel":"BusinessTravelers"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":200214606,"isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":false,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"5423384","totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"photos":[],"reviewId":"63889064","itinId":"166924654843","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"UNK","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":4,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"","brandType":"Expedia","title":"","reviewText":"","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":5,"ratingService":4,"ratingRoomComfort":5,"positiveRemarks":"Location to airport was great - only a 20 minute drive.","negativeRemarks":"Check in could be better - person we were meeting to let us into our room was 15 minutes late.
