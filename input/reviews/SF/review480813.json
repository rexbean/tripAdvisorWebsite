I would stay there again for sure!\r\nIt's close to everything, clean and nice appearance. I like the courtyard inside with all of the hanging vines. The staff is very friendly and helpful. Most speak enough English to get by. I have stayed at a few other places in Leon and consider this to be a great value.

Everything is run-down. The windows are so flimsy that even at the back of the top floor (where our room was located) the nonstop traffic on the boulevard outside keeps you awake.  \r\nThe most disconcerting part of the experience was the staff. The woman at the front desk had never before  seen a credit card that required a PIN number. She panicked when the card machine prompted for a PIN.  When we asked for an extra blanket we were told, \"We'll get it right now.\"  We asked three times over a five-hour period and each time we got the same answer: \"We'll get it right now.\"  I eventually had to insist and accompany one of the employees to the storeroom to pick up the blanket personally.  No one could give us information on how  the Optibus (local public transit)  worked. I don't know where they find these people!\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":2,"ratingHotelCondition":2,"ratingService":1,"ratingRoomComfort":2,"positiveRemarks":"","negativeRemarks":"","locationRemarks":"It's on a strip on a huge boulevard that's not walkable.
