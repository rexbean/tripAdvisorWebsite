Dark wood and flagstone floors and the air of history wafts through the foyer, then, the modern world encroaches by way of a glass lift. The cool interior of the rooms offer a sublime and other worldly experience of seclusion within the four feet deep walls. The Monument hotel is part of the Medieval city as opposed to being a tourist attraction. So to truly immerse yourself in the spirit of Santiago, the San Francisco hotel offers the gateway to that realization. The staff will help you navigate the streets and draw you accurate and concise maps to guide you through. The breakfast buffet offers a first class assortment of delicacies to suit all tastes. The swimming pool and jacuzzi are well maintained and seldom busy, so all in all, I cannot think of a finer way to begin your voyage around Galicia.
