It is literally a doorway, with reception on the 6th floor.  We had 2 family rooms, each with 2 double beds, on the 5th and 6th floors.  The layout of the hotel meant that the family room on the 5th floor basically had its own private bathroom which was a bonus.  The rooms were spotless and the common area offered an amazing view of old San Juan and the waterfront. We were treated to beautiful music being played in the square in front of the hotel. We had 2 nights sitting out on the balcony using the hotels wifi and being serenaded by the most talented singers and musicians.  It was magical. \r\n The elevator to get to the hotel was \"interesting\".  It worked most of the time but was definitely temperamental. After being stuck in it twice my gorgeous13 year old used the stairs.  Make sure you don't overload it and you should be fine.\r\nThere are heaps of spectacular restaurants nearby that serve traditional Puerto Rican food but they are a bit pricey so be prepared.  \r\nOverall we had a lovely 2 days exploring this exquisite city and soaking in the culture.. \r\n...got to love San Juan. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","featured":false,"ratingsOnly":false,"ratingRoomCleanliness":5,"ratingHotelCondition":3,"ratingService":3,"ratingRoomComfort":4,"positiveRemarks":"location location location","negativeRemarks":"\r\nceiling fans in the rooms would help with the heat...It was very hot and hard to sleep at night","locationRemarks":"\r\nThe Fort is next door and there are plenty of places to eat in the old city.

","reviewText":"I booked this hotel because of the price and vicinity to the cruise ship pier and was a little apprehensive about the idea of sharing a bathroom with other guests. However, once we arrived, this did not bother us at all!  There were three bathrooms on our floor and we never had to wait to get into one of them. This hotel has very simple accommodations but has everything you need. The location was PERFECT! Right in the middle of Old San Juan, overlooks a plaza square with bars, restaurants and shopping all right off the hotel doorstep. The hotel has many terraces that overlook the plaza and Old San Juan with spectacular views of the city.

","locationRemarks":"Lots of cafe's, restaurants and bars nearby. Great for cruisers as you can walk to the cruise pier. The hotel is also right next to Fort San Cristobal","lastInitial":"P","userLocation":"Austin, Texas","reviewSubmissionTime":"2015-08-25T20:36:14Z","reviewerCategories":[{"categoryId":"Everyone","categoryLabel":"Everyone"}],"userDisplayName":"","roomTypeId":"","isUnverified":false,"isFlaggable":true,"isRecommended":"YES"},{"hotelId":"9022184","totalPositiveFeedbacks":1,"tpid":"1","eapid":"0","contentLocale":"en_us","totalThanks":1,"photos":[],"reviewId":"55d86fa8e8f46a08f09c19cf","itinId":"1107746312299","moderationStatus":"APPROVED","contentCodes":"UNK HMP MMD","managementResponses":[],"ratingOverall":3,"langId":"1033","userNickname":"Ben","brandType":"Expedia","title":"It was great placement in old San Juan","reviewText":"It was a nice little hotel and it was a room to stay in.
