It\'s a good-size lobby with the basics, which is perfect for getting out to your destination quickly.  The rooms are well furnished and the furniture updated in mine, which I appreciated.  It had nice old style windows to open and enjoy the SF 1st summer air, with newer windows fitted on top which I could keep closed to insulate the noise and heat if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe bed was tremendously comfortable, as were the sheets.  The bathroom was nicely done in old stone (marble?) in a very upscale older pattern.\r\n\r\nA few areas like the doors and some trim were visibly older, but everything was well-maintained, and anything that needed updating had been, like the key card entry system and the desk lamps with charging plugs.  There was also in-room AC (that isn\'t a window unit - those don\'t count) which, while old, was perfectly serviceable.\r\n\r\nNothing that showed it\'s age was an inconvenience in any way, and the room still felt nice and clean and modern.\r\n\r\nThe bathroom was certainly smaller, and was lacking in any sort of counter space, but there was plenty of desk space and mirrors so that made up for it.  I will say it lacked a full-size floor mirror.\r\n\r\nLoved the staff, everyone was very friendly and prompt, and I\'d happily stay here for the price and location alone.', 'true', 'Mon Apr 18 00:00:00 PDT 2016', 'anonymous'), ('412', '11793', '5713934d1fcf7f09f85da04e', '1', 'Gross!', 'First night, i walked into the bathroom and there was a crusty mens underwear haning from the shower curtain rod.

Went back down and another person said no, that was a smaller room but they ran out and had one out of service.  So rather than telling me the truth they were deceptive.  When I asked how the would compensate for the difference they said they couldn\'t since I prepaid.  Yeah, right!\r\n\r\nNext day they moved us to the proper suite for the next 4 nights and only provided $25 of compensation.

Unfortunately our stay was ruined by two poor policy decisions by the hotel management.  On check-in, I made it clear I was using a debit card and was assured that no deductions would be made during \"pre-authorization\". This was untrue as $100 was immediately deducted and after we spent more than the $100 on a meal, not only was another $100 deducted but also the cost of the meal as well.  We now had over $300 not available on our debit card. We are assured it will be returned - in 5 days.  So my advice - do not use a debit card in this hotel even when you\'re told it will be OK.  The second is the Free WiFi fine print. The hotel advertises that free wifi is available. They don\'t tell you that it is NOT available free to Expedia bookings!! Expedia clients get one hour free wifi - only in the lounge, only for one device per room and only once per stay - seriously.  Free wifi is only available to loyalty program members, corporate clients and people who book directly thru the hotel website.  None of this is made clear anywhere until arrival. Free WiFi should be available in all hotels and for this hotel to gouge its Expedia clients in this way is unforgivable.  If you get caught like we did, persist with your request for free wifi and the staff will eventually provide an access code! Also allow an hour to checkout!

The bartender took our order, gave me my bud light but didn\'t get my husband his cocktail for 10 minutes. Instead she thought it was more important to take a few dirty cups to the kitchen. We clearly were just wanting to get drinks and go back up but she was rude and told us to sit down and served several others ahead of us.

It took quite a while to pull up to the door to unload our bags while my better half checked in since we were planning to self-park. Despite requesting early check in, our rooms were not ready until almost 5pm. Then everything became better. Our room was beautiful with views of the bay, and feather free as requested due to our allergies. After a fantastic dinner at Coi, we returned to our room to enjoy the city lights. The next morning, we had a nice breakfast that was included with our stay. The area surrounding the hotel was fun to walk around, especially with the beautiful weather.
